This is the code from the main function of the chat window as a separate application, need to find a way to implement this as a button
on the Main screen of the game window, so that pressing the "chat" button will open this separate chat screen.

Also need to work out player to player messaging as this chat would include the entirety of the network.

#include "MyServer.h"
#include <QCoreApplication>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    QCoreApplication app(argc, argv);

    ChatterBoxServer *server = new ChatterBoxServer();
    bool success = server->listen(QHostAddress::Any, 4200);
    if(!success)
    {
        qFatal("Could not listen on port 4200.");
    }

    qDebug() << "Ready";

    return app.exec();
}

#include "MainWindow.h"
#include <QApplication>

THIS IS THE CLIENT MAIN FILE

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    // Every Qt GUI needs a QApplication.
    QApplication app(argc, argv);

    // This is your MainWindow that you created with Designer
    // Declare it and show it.
    MainWindow mainWindow;
    mainWindow.show();

    // This will not return until the last window is closed.
    // This runs the GUI's event loop handling painting and
    // user input and stuff like that.
    return app.exec();
}
